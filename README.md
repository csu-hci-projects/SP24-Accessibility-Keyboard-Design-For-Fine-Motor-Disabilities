# SP24-Accessibility-Keyboard-Design-For-Fine-Motor-Disabilities

### _Motivation_
This HCI research was inspired by witnissing multiple different kinds of disabilities within students and the impact of standardized input devices used such as a computer keyboard. The goal of this project is to help gain a better understanding of small adjustments on an average keyboard that may help improve the quality of life for individuals with motor disabilities, visual disabilities, and learning disabilities. 

### _Method_
_*this will be updated as the method proccess progresses*_
A webbased application utilizing students touch screen computers will be used to demonstrate the diffrences between a standard keyboard and the changes suggusted during this research. Ten consenting participants were first tested with the sentance "The Quick Brown Fox Jumped Over The Lazy Dog." on a standard touch screen keyboard that is preprogrammed into the laptop. To minimize outside variables the same laptop was used during all participant tests.
